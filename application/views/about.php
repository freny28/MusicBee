	<p style="margin-bottom:30px;">I am a music lover, but I fail to organize my songs and like to hear new songs suggested by someone. I got an idea why can't we collect all music fans to organize their own songs by different categories and on other hand, can see other user's song list with similar taste and add to their own list.</p>
	
	<p style="margin-bottom:30px;">MusicBee's Assembly is a web application which allows the user to organize their songs by categories which can be customize by the user. In addition to this, user will be able to see other user's song list and profile. This application requires the user to get register and gave an option to make their profile public or private. The public profile will be visible to other users too and the private user's profile will remain private. Every user will able to see the public user's profile and song list, able to add the song to their list.
